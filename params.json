It will be a 2D side-scrolling platform game.\r\n\r\n# Story\r\nThe FACTORY is polluting the environment with air and water pollution. As an environmental hero, the player's task is to avoid being poisoned by the pollution, collect the items required to craft a filter for the FACTORY, and install the filter in the FACTORY to complete the level.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, the main character cleans up the environment by removing the pollutants (enemies). This is achieved by the use of an 'air gun'. The gun can be fired at 'enemies' (smog and oil), to clean the environment.\r\n\r\nThe level slowly fills with smog and water pollution. If the player cannot remove the pollutants and install the factory filter in time, the screen goes black, and the player dies.\r\n\r\n#Environment and Level Design\r\nTerrain types - platforms on land and underwater.\r\nSome platforms may move.\r\nThere will be pressure pads to open doors/trapdoors in the level.\r\n\r\n# Player\r\nAn environmental warrior that wants to clean up the environment, and educate the player about the dangers of water and air pollution. \r\n\r\nMovement - Left/right,  Swim, (Special ability: double-jump or dash)\r\n\r\nPlayer variables - Health Bar: affected by lack of air, poison, and touching enemies.\r\n\r\n#Enemies\r\nMain enemy (Boss) - the FACTORY (A factory spewing out air and water pollution)\r\nWater enemies - Oil (Blobs of oil/slick in the water)\r\nLand/air enemies - Air pollution (smog clouds)\r\n\r\nEnemy movement - Left/right/up/down, simple AI (patrolling system/random movement)\r\n\r\nEnemy properties - Toxic to main player (player touches enemy, reduces health)\r\n\r\n#Collectibles/Items\r\nAir (from canisters)\r\nPieces of filter (to be collected and combined into LARGE FILTER to complete the level)\r\nHealth pickups\r\n\r\n#UI elements\r\nSplash Screen:\r\nStart Game\r\nResume (Pause Screen)\r\nQuit\r\n\r\n#HUD elements (visual)\r\nHealth Bar\r\nAir Supply (when air ==0, reduces health)\r\nPoison (slowly drains the player of health) - screen brightness and amount of pollution in the air/water.\r\n\r\n# Scope\r\nAs a small team on an ambitious deadline, we are limiting the scope to delivering one complete level of the game.\r\n\r\n# Platform\r\nThe platform will initially be the PC desktop, with possible expansion to mobile platforms later.\r\n\r\n# Delivery Date\r\nMay 24th\r\n\r\n#Contributors:\r\n@huntit\r\n@maxfinn\r\n@rilakkuma45","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
